i mean at the end of the day you could like just use people's prefered pronouns

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:05
Aand now you too

0J3



 — Today at 00:06
if you can give me the exact scentence in whatever the version of the bible in your religion is that states that u shouldnt use prefered pronouns, maybe u wouldnt lose that many friends
[00:06]
see im notgonna block u or anything
[00:06]
im just saying, maybe everyone else expects you to like not be transphobic?
[00:06]
and if u are gonna say its because of your religion, atleast like provide some sources?

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:07
I don't post sources

0J3



 — Today at 00:07
i didnt say post them
[00:07]
since u say

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:07
because I don't like to go into detail
[00:07]
Well I'll give you this

0J3



 — Today at 00:07
that because of ur religion
[00:07]
u refer to ppl by their birth pronouns

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:07
Becaus I don't believe in being born the wrong gender

0J3



 — Today at 00:08
so some people (normalcat, celestial, etc...) would maybe accept it if u provided the actual religion saying that

@Krinj_skrem

Becaus I don't believe in being born the wrong gender

0J3



 — Today at 00:08
see it's not necesarily the wrong gender, but rather the non-prefered one

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:09
There are no verses against the bible, but I'll let you hang on some implications

0J3



 — Today at 00:09
i'm non-binary (a demigirl), meaning i'm not really male - but i don't necesarily think it's the wrong gender, but rather one that doesn't fit with me

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:09
In the bible, humans have only been referrd to as he or her, and in creation, godmade man and woman, and it has never changed
[00:10]
I believe God didn't command any verses against transgenderism because it doesnt need any

0J3



 — Today at 00:10
so after you post these implications, i would like you to look at this, and then think if doing something thats easy to avoid, but annoys others significantly is nice

Uhh
[00:10]
I severely disagree

@Krinj_skrem

In the bible, humans have only been referrd to as he or her, and in creation, godmade man and woman, and it has never changed

0J3



 — Today at 00:11
see even if that was the case, being trans male to female, or female to male, doesnt really go against that

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:11
religions were made because people had different opinions on what was right and wrong

0J3



 — Today at 00:11
and the bible never changing is because it's something with so many different copies that it's impossible to change them all

@Krinj_skrem

religions were made because people had different opinions on what was right and wrong

0J3



 — Today at 00:11
ok but see, ur looking at individual religions
[00:11]
look at what every religion has in common
[00:12]
in whatever it'(edited)
in whatever it's version of the bible is
[00:12]
they all say BE NICE TO EACHOTHER in some way shape or form

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:12
Yup
[00:12]
but there are also laws
[00:12]
on whats right and wrong

0J3



 — Today at 00:12
yeah but like what does that have to do with this topci(edited)

0J3



 — Today at 00:14
not refering to people by their prefered pronouns is being rude

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:14
I was being as polite as I could think to be
[00:14]
I don't ever insult people on their beliefs, I just politely disagree

It's called not denying my entire religion for someone's slight (should be, idk why people are so crazy about it) comfort

0J3



 — Today at 00:15
see here's the thing
[00:15]
if it isnt strictly against the religion
[00:15]
and we aren't talking about implications or that dumb shit
[00:15]
then it isn't against the fucking religion

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:15
Uhm
[00:15]
Except it is
[00:15]
And even if it wasn't, not sure why you all are being extremely horribly to me about it

0J3



 — Today at 00:15
and even just referring to someone like normalcat using she/her isn't denying anything you've said here

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:16
It isn't

0J3



 — Today at 00:16
so why didnt u do that lol

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:16
I'm not denying anything except your assumptions about my religion

@Krinj_skrem

And even if it wasn't, not sure why you all are being extremely horribly to me about it

0J3



 — Today at 00:16
because that's what humans do - call out things that are wrong according to most if not all people
[00:16]
see my parents are both christian
[00:16]
so i could jsut ask them

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:16
Now, I'm sorry my religion is so horrible and disgusting and racist, but if you hate me for no real reason, the  I'm out

0J3



 — Today at 00:16
also you don't need to deny your whole religion to deny a tiny part of it
[00:17]
im sorry but the reason is that if your religion tells you to jump off a bridge, would you jump off a bridge? no. so why can't it be this way for things like fucking pronouns
[00:17]
the reason is, human decency is more important than implications in a religion

Krinj_skrem

 — Today at 00:17
Uhh
[00:17]
Except I'm pretty loyal about it
[00:17]
Don't see why you are making a huge duss about it

0J3



im sorry but the reason is that if your religion tells you to jump off a bridge, would you jump off a bridge? no. so why can't it be this way for things like fucking pronouns

 — Today at 00:18

[00:18]
